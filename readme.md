A simple exercise logger for you to measure your progress!
## Getting Started:
Note: Use help to display this message
* **exit or 0**: stop the program
* **show [cardio or weights]**: display existing logs
* **add [cardio or weights]**: create an exercise log

## Motivation & Features
This project is a simple command line based tool that helps you to keep track of your workouts. The purpose of this project is to gain an understanding of the repository pattern in C#. To further cement my comprehension using this pattern, I explored using two kinds of workouts - cardio and weight workouts. Cardio workouts are fetched using the Entity Framework and SQLite for weight workouts.
